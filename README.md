# Instructions

Open a terminal interface and run: `make run`

Note: only Linux distributions are supported for now; program doesn't have Windows support yet.

# TODO

1. Add more details in this README

2. Add more detailed comments in at least the CUDA source code file

3. <s>Add support for sorting 64-bit integer types as compile-time feature</s> Author deems
      this not very important right now.

4. Add unit tests at least for the CUDA kernels - Author is finding this difficult;
      any outside help would be appreciated; more than willing to refactor code to
      make unit tests easier :)
